# /hxm:commit - Smart git commit tool based on provided arguments or staged changes.

## Purpose

CRITICAL: Follow the Process section exactly - this tool analyzes staged changes, generates conventional commit messages, and executes git commits through a strict validation workflow. Do not diverge from the defined process.

## Usage

```bash
/hxm:commit [--all] [--files <file1> <file2> ...]
```

## Arguments

- `--all`: Stage all modified files with `git add .` before analyzing the diff
- `--files <file1> <file2> ...`: Stage only the specified files before analyzing the diff
- No arguments: Work with already staged changes only

## Process

**CRITICAL: This command MUST execute only in execution mode. When in plan mode (indicated by system reminders or restrictions on tool usage), immediately output the following error message and stop execution:**

"‚ùå Error: This command requires execution mode. Please exit plan mode first to execute git operations."

**Proceed with the following steps only when in execution mode:**

1. **Argument Processing**
   - If both `--all` and `--files` are provided: Exit with error "Use either --all or --files, not both"
   - If `--all` is provided: Stage all modified files with `git add .`
   - If `--files <file1> <file2>` is provided: Stage only specified files with `git add <files>`
   - If no arguments: Proceed with existing staged changes only

2. **Validation Check**
   - Run `git diff --cached` to check staged changes
   - **CRITICAL: When staged changes exist: Continue to step 3 with the diff in memory**
   - **When NO staged changes exist: Stop and inform user "No staged changes found. Use --all, --files, or manually stage changes first."**

3. **Commit Generation**
   - Analyze the staged diff to determine appropriate commit type (feat, fix, docs, refactor, style, test, chore, etc.)
   - Generate conventional commit message following the format described in the Notes section below
   - Execute the commit using `git commit -m "<message>"`
   - When the commit succeeds: Display success confirmation
   - When the commit fails: Display the error message and exit

## Notes

### Commit Message Format

Follows Git Conventional Commits format with optional descriptions for additional context:

#### Basic Format

- `feat(scope): add new feature`
- `fix(scope): resolve bug in component`
- `docs(scope): update documentation`
- `refactor(scope): restructure code without changing behavior`
- `style(scope): formatting changes`
- `test(scope): add or update tests`
- `chore(scope): maintenance tasks`

#### Extended Format with Description

For complex changes that need additional context, the command can generate multi-line commit messages with descriptions:

- `feat(auth): add user authentication`

  `Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens and role-based access control`

- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`

  `Adjust flexbox properties to properly center action buttons across different screen sizes`

- `refactor(api): restructure user service`

  `Split monolithic user service into separate authentication and profile management modules for better maintainability`

#### Guidelines

- The scope should reflect the area of the codebase being changed (e.g., api, ui, docs, config)
- The command automatically determines when additional description is needed based on the complexity and nature of the changes
- Descriptions provide context about the "why" and "how" of the changes, complementing the concise subject line
